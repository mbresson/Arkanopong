  ========================

Arkanopong is a game mixing the gameplay of pong and bricks breaking. It is written in C.
It was a short-term project developed in a few weeks at IMAC engineering school (http://ingenieur-imac.fr/). 
It requires SDL, SDL_TTF, SDL_mixer, SDL_image, libGL and libGLU to be linked against.
It is GPLv3-licensed (see LICENSE for further information).
You may read the report I have made for my work in rapport.pdf (in French).

I created all the .png images for the game using Inkscape and the background image of the basic theme is a photo I took on a travel to Laos. You can do What The Fuck You Want To with them (WTFPL).
I created all the .wav audio files for the game using Audacity. You can do WTFPL as well.
